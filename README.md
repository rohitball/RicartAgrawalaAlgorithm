# RicartAgrawalaAlgorithm
Demonstration of Ricart Agrawala Algorithm

The program assumes, the distributed system has 3 processes, with process ids 0, 1, and 2.
The program executes following sequence. The sequence is hard-coded in the test application, to reduce the complexity. User need not feed any input. In each transaction ‘delays’ are added to simulate real time communication delays. The program demonstrates how Ricart – Agrawala Algorithm works in a distributed system.
